# Parth
## A language for me

This project is a small interpreter for the Parth programming language. This language isn't going to displace Ruby or Javascript or anything, it's half a pet project and half a grand ambition for a future game.

My C++ skills are very rusty and were never polished in the first place, so don't expect this code to be a paragon of structure and design. This is also technically my first interpreter (first implemented in much cleaner Golang, but this is more of a migration from that). Because of that, and the fact that I'm not a college educated scholar who never took a compiler theory class means that Parth will not be the most optimized or the most complete language. However, I've got spunk and free time, and those are the most delicious ingredients in the recipe we call life.

A specification will probably be eventually written maybe (I hope).
