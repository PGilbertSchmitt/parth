# Parth
## A language for me

This project is a small interpreter for the Parth programming language. This language isn't going to displace Ruby or Javascript or anything, but it is inspired by both. It's half a pet project and half a grand ambition for a future game.

My C++ skills are a bit rusty and were never polished in the first place, so I wouldn't expect this code to be a paragon of structure and design. This is also technically my first interpreter (though I did first implement it in much cleaner Golang, and this started as a migration from that). Because of that, and the fact that I don't have a fancy college degree, Parth will not be the most optimized or the most complete language. However, I've got spunk, free time, and a handful of ideas, and those are the most delicious ingredients in the recipe we call life.

A specification will probably be eventually written maybe (I hope).
